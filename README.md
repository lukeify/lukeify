# 👋 I'm **Luke**

I am a software engineer living near [📍 Alexandra, New Zealand](https://maps.apple.com/?ll=-45.100000,169.400000)—within the Central Otago basin—adjacent to some of the best mountain paragliding in New Zealand.

I specialise in crafting majestic monoliths upon Rails & Laravel; but also enjoy building upon frontend frameworks for the web, authoring iOS apps for fun, and dabbling in Rust/C when writing tools and scripts.

Stay learning, stay curious.
